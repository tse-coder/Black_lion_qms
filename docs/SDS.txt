1. Introduction

This Software Design Specification (SDS) provides a comprehensive technical design for the
Digital Queue Management System (DQMS) developed for the Ethiopian Black Lion Hospital. It
expands upon the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) by translating functional and non-
functional requirements into architectural structures, component designs, data models, and
interaction diagrams. This document serves as the primary guide for developers, system analysts,
testers, and ICT technicians in constructing and maintaining the system.

The SDS ensures that all system components, interfaces, and operational flows are clearly defined
and traceable to the requirements, ensuring consistency, reliability, and a shared understanding of
the system’s technical blueprint.

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this System Design document is to translate the business requirements and
hospital workflow processes identified in the SRS into a detailed technical design that will guide
the development of the Digital Queue Management System (DQMS). It serves as a bridge
between requirement analysis and actual system implementation Specifically, the SDS aims to;
- Define the system’s architecture, components, modules, and interactions.
- Describe data structures, processing logic, and workflow behavior.
- Provide developers with a clear blueprint for coding and system integration.
- Support testers in validating system functionality and performance.
- Ensure long-term maintainability, scalability, and alignment with hospital operations.

1.2 General Overview

The Digital Queue Management System (DQMS) is designed to automate, monitor, and
streamline patient queue operations at Black Lion Hospital. The system operates within the
hospital’s infrastructure and interacts with various hardware and software components such as:
- Patient self-service kiosks
- Digital display screens
- Administrative workstations
- Local servers and optional cloud backup services
The system uses a layered architectural approach composed of:
1. Presentation Layer – handles user interfaces for patients and staff.
2. Application/Business Logic Layer – processes queue logic, token management, and service
flow.
3. Data Layer – manages data storage related to patients, queues, logs, and system usage.
The high-level context diagram from the SRS has been updated to reflect improved
understanding of subsystem interactions. Changes include clearer separation between the kiosk
subsystem and the administrative queue management interface, and the addition of a real-time
display communication service.




                                                                                                 1

Design goals include:
- Minimizing patient waiting time and congestion
- Ensuring real-time and accurate queue information
- Maintaining system reliability during peak hospital hours
- Supporting scalability for multiple specialized departments
- Ensuring security and controlled access to administrative functions

1.3 Development Methods & Contingencies

The design of the DQMS uses an Object-Oriented Design (OOD) methodology supported by
Unified Modeling Language (UML). This approach ensures modularity, reusability, and
maintainability through clearly defined classes and object interactions.


Methods considered:
- Structured Design: efficient for simple workflows but not suitable for the modular and scalable
needs of DQMS.
- Prototyping Model: helpful for interface refinement but insufficient for overall system
structure.
- Object-Oriented Design (Selected): provides strong abstraction, better scalability, and fits well
with UML documentation.


UML artifacts used include:
- Use Case Diagrams
- Class Diagrams
- Activity Diagrams
- Sequence Diagrams
- Deployment Diagrams


Contingencies that may influence system design include:
- Changes in hospital workflow or patient processing policy
- Delays in obtaining integration details from third-party display system vendors
- Infrastructure limitations such as poor local network reliability
- Future need to integrate with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems


Workarounds and adaptation measures:
- Maintain modular subsystem boundaries to isolate potential changes
- Use API-based communication for flexible integration
- Include fallback offline modes for kiosk operations
- Use iterative development cycles to incorporate evolving requirements




                                                                                                  2

2. System Architecture


2.1 Subsystem Decomposition

The Digital Queue Management System (QMS) adopts a modular, layered architecture that
separates concerns and promotes maintainability. The system is decomposed into four primary
subsystems that work collaboratively to deliver the required functionality while ensuring
scalability, security, and interoperability with existing hospital systems.



Architecture Overview:


The system follows a client-server model with a web-based frontend and a robust backend
service layer. This decomposition enables clear separation between user interface concerns,
business logic, data management, and external system integrations. Each subsystem is designed
to be independently testable and deployable, following the principles of high cohesion and low
coupling.

Subsystem Responsibilities:



   1. User Interface (UI) Subsystem: Serves as the primary interaction point for all users
      including patients, doctors, lab technicians, and administrators. It provides responsive web
      interfaces optimized for various devices and manages real-time display updates for public
      screens. This subsystem handles both the patient-facing portal for queue management and
      the staff-facing dashboard for queue administration.
   2. Application Logic Subsystem: Implements the core business rules and workflow
      management. This subsystem handles user authentication and authorization, queue
      processing algorithms, notification scheduling, and coordinates all system operations. It
      contains the essential business logic for queue allocation, wait time calculations, and
      automatic queue management functions.
   3. Data Management Subsystem: Provides persistent storage and retrieval of all system data
      including patient information, queue records, user accounts, and audit logs. Ensures data
      integrity and supports transaction management while maintaining compliance with data
      retention policies specified in the SRS.
   4. External Integration Subsystem: Manages all external communications and data
      exchanges. This includes integration with the hospital's Ewket EMR system using HL7
      FHIR standards and communication with SMS gateway services for patient notifications.
      This subsystem ensures seamless interoperability with existing hospital systems while
      maintaining data consistency.

2.3 Access Control

Access control defines how different users interact with the Digital Queue Management System
and ensures that sensitive health-related information is accessed only by authorized personnel. The
system uses a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, where each user role is assigned
specific permissions according to its responsibilities within the hospital workflow.

1. Access Control Model

The system implements RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with four primary roles:

1. Patient

2. Doctor

3. Lab Technician

4. Administrator

Each role is granted access only to the operations necessary for performing its tasks.
All access rights follow the least-privilege principle, ensuring users can only perform what is
essential for their responsibilities.

2. User Roles and Permissions

The Dynamic Model supplements the static Class Diagram by illustrating the system's time-
dependent behavior and the lifecycle of core entities. This section details the system's operational
flow using the Sequence Diagram (3.2.1) and the State Chart Diagram (3.2.2).

       3.2.1 Sequence Diagram: Patient Check-in and Queue Assignment

The Sequence Diagram illustrates the temporal order of object interactions for the Patient Check-
in and Queue Assignment use case. This process is initiated by the Receptionist upon patient
arrival and involves the core system components responsible for data verification and service
assignment. The diagram is critical for validating the system's compliance with functional
requirement 2.1 (Patient Registration).

The sequence explicitly details the conditional logic (alt fragment) required to handle both existing
patient verification against the Patient Records (DB) and the persistent registration of new patient
data. The successful completion of this sequence results in a confirmed QueueEntry object being
created in the Queue Records (DB), and the assigned identifier and Estimated Wait Time (EWT)
being communicated back to the Receptionist.

Description of Flow:

   1. Initiation: The Patient provides necessary identification to the Receptionist, initiating the
      sequence of object interactions.
   2. Verification: The Receptionist triggers the QMS - Core Services to perform a lookup in
      the centralized Patient Records (DB).
   3. Conditional Registration: An alternative flow is executed if the patient is not found (alt
      fragment). This path includes the collection of required demographic data by the
      Receptionist and the subsequent secure persistence of a new patient record in the Patient
      Records (DB).
   4. Service Request: The Receptionist determines the required service specialty (e.g.,
      Cardiology, General Practice) and requests queue allocation from the QMS.
   5. Assignment & EWT Calculation: The QMS instructs the Queue Records (DB) to create
      a new QueueEntry and calculate the Estimated Wait Time (EWT) based on current
      departmental load, active doctor count, and historical service metrics.
   6. Confirmation: The final queue identifier and EWT are returned to the QMS, which relays
      them to the Receptionist for communication to the patient.



   3.2.2 State Chart Diagram: Queue Entry Lifecycle

The State Chart Diagram models the behavior and permissible transitions of the core system entity,
the QueueEntry object. This diagram is essential for defining the integrity of the real-time queue
data and ensures that a patient's status can only transition through defined, valid states, aligning
with functional requirement 2.3 (Real-Time Status Monitoring).

The lifecycle starts with the initial Waiting state upon check-in and concludes with the terminal
states of Complete or Cancelled. The diagram explicitly models the critical events (e.g.,
Doctor/Nurse Calls Patient, Visit Concluded, Interruption/Reschedule) that trigger state changes
and demonstrates the system's resilience by modeling the non-terminal transition from InProgress
back to Waiting to support operational scenarios like temporary patient hold or transfer.

Waiting        The entry is active, the patient is physically Initial Check-in
               waiting, and the entry is available for doctor
               selection.


InProgress     The patient has been called by the Doctor/Nurse Doctor/Nurse            Calls
               and is currently occupying a consultation slot. This Patient
               state locks the entry from further selection
               attempts.



Complete       The consultation or service is successfully finished. Visit          Concluded
               This is a terminal state, triggering final archival and (Discharged)
               service reporting functions.




Cancelled      The queue entry has been prematurely terminated Patient
               due to patient withdrawal, administrative action, or Leaves/Appointment
               no-show. This is a terminal state.                   Canceled, Emergency

Interruption   (Transition from InProgress back to Waiting) Interruption/Reschedule
               Indicates a temporary hold or transfer, making the
               entry available for re-selection once the patient
               returns to the waiting area.

4.2 System Component Interaction Summary

      Patient registers → QueueManager generates a queue number.
      QueueManager stores queue data in the Database.
      When patient is close to their turn:
          o NotificationService sends SMS and on-screen alerts.
      Admin manages queue flow:
          o Cancels requests.
          o Reassigns patients to available doctors.
      Doctors update patient status via Doctor Dashboard.

4.3 Compliance with EMR Standards

      Modular architecture supports future EMR integration.
      Data exchange supports HL7 / FHIR for interoperability.
