3.2.1.4 Output
The system shall send alerts to patient’s or caretaker’s devices in addition to displaying them on
the central screen available in the lobbies. The alerts shall be sent when the patients turn comes
and also when there are few people left in front of a patient so the patients will be more likely to
avail themselves.


3.2.1.5 Error Handling
A clear error message shall be displayed if the user enters an invalid patient card number.
3.2.2 Automatic queue member removal
3.2.2.1 Introduction
Sometimes patients fail to come in time for the service they registered in queue for. There is a
adjustable wait time of one minute for such cases. This feature is required since there are cases
where the patient doesn’t arrive even after the wait time. Therefore, they will be removed from the
queue.
3.2.2.2 Inputs
The patients’ card number used to process the removal.
3.2.2.3 Processing
The entity for the patient queue will be deleted.
3.2.2.4 Outputs
A message will be displayed informing the patient that they missed their turn and urge them to
register again if they still want the service.

4. Change Management Process
The process for updating the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) ensures that all
modifications to project scope, requirements, or system behavior are systematically reviewed,
approved, and documented. This maintains alignment with project objectives, technical feasibility,
and stakeholder expectations.

Change Submission:
Any project team member (developer, tester, or system analyst) can propose a change to the
SRS. Change requests are submitted through formal documentation updates, clearly describing
the reason for the change, its potential impact, and the affected components or requirements.

Review and Approval:
All submitted changes are reviewed by the ICT Staff Manager, who is responsible for
evaluating the technical and operational impact of the proposed modification.

      Major changes (e.g., new system features, integration adjustments, or interoperability
       updates) require formal approval from the ICT Staff Manager before implementation.
      Minor updates (e.g., documentation corrections or small UI adjustments) may be
       approved informally after brief internal review by the technical team.

Version Control and Documentation:
Manual document versioning will be maintained to track all SRS updates. Each approved change
will result in an incremented version number, with a summary of modifications recorded in the
document’s revision history section. Superseded versions will be archived for reference.

Notification and Implementation:
Upon approval, the technical/project team will be notified of the change for implementation and
verification. In cases of major updates, all key stakeholders — including system administrators




                                                                                                14
